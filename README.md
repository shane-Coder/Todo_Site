# Todo_Site
Hello everyone this is my project on a to-do list that everyone makes for their work, goals, and many more things.
It is based on Django (the Python web framework, we use for making our websites), here for the front end I use HTML, and Bootstrap code which I take from online websites.
I use Django because it provides us with built-in features for everything including Django Admin Interface, default database â€“ SQLlite3, etc, a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc. Django gives you ready-made components to use and that too for rapid development.
